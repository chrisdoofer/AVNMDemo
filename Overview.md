# Azure Virtual Network Manager Overview

Azure Virtual Network Manager is a management service that enables you to group, configure, deploy, and manage virtual networks globally across subscriptions. With Virtual Network Manager, you can define network groups to identify and logically segment your virtual networks. Then you can determine the connectivity and security configurations you want and apply them across all the selected virtual networks in network groups at once.  This solves a gap that has existed for sometime around managing vNet connectivity and securioty at cloud scale.

This demo environment seeks to provide a pre-configured environment to demonstrate the following key use cases:

1. Connectivity 

    a) Configuring Full Mesh Network
    
    b) Configuring Hub & Spoke
    
    c) Configuring Hub & Spoke with Direct Spoke Connectivity

2. Security
